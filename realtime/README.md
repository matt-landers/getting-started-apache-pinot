# Real-time Tables in Apache Pinot

In this example, we're going to ingest events into Apache Pinot from the [Wikipedia Event Platform](https://wikitech.wikimedia.org/wiki/Event_Platform/EventStreams#JavaScript)

⭐️ Create a Schema for the Events  
⭐️ Create a Real-time Table  
⭐️ Send events to Pinot through Apache Kafka  
🚀 Query the Events in Real-time
